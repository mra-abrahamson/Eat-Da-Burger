### How The App Should Work
Eat-Da-Burger! A restaurant app that lets you input the name of a burger. When you submit a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Whenyou click it, the burger will move to the right side of the page to show that it's been eaten. a mySQl database stores every burger, whether devoured or not.
